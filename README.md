# MIT-6.828-JOS  
It's a really good OS course  
lab/finished contains code from lab1 to lab6  
  
Most of lab1 to lab5 are completed by myself  
Most code of lab6 are copied from [petroav](https://github.com/petroav/6.828), his code has explicit annotation and is easy to read  
[macfij](https://github.com/macfij/macfij_jos)'s repo and [Clann24](https://github.com/Clann24/jos)'s repo are useful too.  
Thanks to them for sharing their code!
